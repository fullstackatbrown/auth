A `.env` secret file is needed to run the backend server. Request a copy of this file through our slack channel.

To start the backend server, make sure you are in the `server` folder by running `cd server` from the project root, then run `make run` to start the backend server.

To start the frontend client, make sure you are in the `client` folder by running `cd client` from the project root, then run `npm install` to install necessary packages, and run `npm start` to start the frontend.
